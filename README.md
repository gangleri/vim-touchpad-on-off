vim-touchad-on-off
==================

A simple VIM plugin that I wrote to allow me to quickly turn the touch pad off 
and on while working on my laptop. The original version was written on Ubuntu
13.10 I've since changed to Arch and have updated this plugin to use [Synclient](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics#Synclient)

Default shot cut is &lt;leader&gt;ttp
